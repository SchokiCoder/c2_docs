## Operator precedence

Precedence rules in C2 are different from C/C++. Here are all precedence levels in C2, listed
from highest (1) to lowest (11):

1. `()`, `[]`, `.`, postfix `++` and `--`
2. prefix `-`, `~`, prefix `*`, `&`, prefix `++` and `--`
3. infix `*`, `/`, `%`
4. `<<`, `>>`
5. `^`, `|`, infix `&`
6. `+`, infix `-`
7. `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`
8. `&&`, `||`
9. ternary `?:`
10. `=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `+=`, `-=`, `<<=`, `>>=`, `&=`, `^=`, `|=`
11. `,`

The main difference is that bitwise operations and shift has higher precedence than
addition/subtraction and multiplication/division in C2. Bitwise operations also have
higher precedence than the relational operators. Also, there is no difference in
precedence between && || or between the bitwise operators.

### Examples

```c
a + b >> c + d

(a + b) >> (c + d) // C (+ - are evaluated before >>)
a + (b >> c) + d   // C2 (>> is evaluated before + -)


a & b == c

a & (b == c)       // C  (bitwise operators are evaluated after relational)
(a & b) == c       // C2 (bitwise operators are evaluated before relational)


a || b && c

a || (b && c)      // C  (&& binds tighter than ||)
(a || b) && c      // C2 (Same precedence, left-to-right evaluation)


a > b == c < d

(a > b) == (c < d) // C  (< > binds tighter than ==)
((a > b) == c) < d // C2 (Same precedence, left-to-right evaluation)


a | b ^ c & d

a | ((b ^ c) & d)  // C  (All bitwise operators have different precedence)
((a | b) ^ c) & d  // C2 (Same precedence, left-to-right evaluation)
```

The change in precedence of the bitwise operators corrects a long standing issue in the C
specification. The change in precedence for shift operations goes towards making the
precedence less surprising.

Conflating the precedence of || and &&, relational and equality operations, and all bitwise
operations was motivated by simplification: few remember the exact internal differences in
precedence between bitwise operators.

Left-to-right offers a very simple model to think about the internal order of operations,
and encourages use of explicit ordering, as best practice in C is to use parentheses anyway.
